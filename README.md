# My Next.js Application

This is my first Next.js application, featuring a basic home page with navigation bar and linking between pages.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the project.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install dependencies.
3. Start the development server using `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`.

## Project Structure

* `pages`: Contains the home page and other pages.
* `components`: Holds the navigation bar component and other custom components.

## Components and Pages

* `NavBar.js`: A custom navigation bar component.
* `HomePage.js`: The main home page component.

## Navigation Bar

The navigation bar is a custom component that links to other pages in the application.

## Future Development

I plan to add more features, such as a blog section and user authentication.
